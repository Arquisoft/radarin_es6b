=== Level 1

Motivation::

The application has two main blocks; which are Radarin and Solid Server. All Radarin components communicate with Solid Server; but in turn these are independent in order to separate the different layers and prevent a simple modification from having a great impact on the application.

The user is given the possibility to access the Solid Server directly; although this possibility is not currently in use.


Contained Building Blocks::
