This section shows a general image of the different levels of application architecture:

=== Level 1

Motivation::

The application has two main blocks; which are Radarin and Solid Server. All Radarin components communicate with Solid Server; but in turn these are independent in order to separate the different layers and prevent a simple modification from having a great impact on the application.

The user is given the possibility to access the Solid Server directly; although this possibility is not currently in use.


Contained Building Blocks::

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header"]
|===
|Name|Responsability
| _Graphic interface_ | _Manage user communication with the application._
| _Business layer_ | _Treat the data obtained from the graphical interface and execute actions._
| _Persistance_ | _Treats data that is going to be persistent; that is, the data that is going to be kept on a server._
| _NoPersistance_ | _It treats the data that will be used in the session that is started at that moment._
