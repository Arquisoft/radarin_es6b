== Tests

We have developed three different types os tests in order to avoid the biggest ammount of issues.

=== TDD and continuous integration

A requirement of the project was to have tests that covered as much of the application as possible. To achieve this objective we use the library "testing-library" since it is compatible with react.

==== Webapp

We have done 24 tests in webapp to be sure that our app render correctly regardless of the size of the screen. 
In addition, we have also verifies that in each view appears what has to appear.

Here is an example of a TDD test on the About view:

And here you can see the 24 tests passing correctly:

==== Restapi

We did a test in restapi checking most of the requests that can be made to the server.

=== BDD and acceptance tests

At first we created the tests using pupeeter. This way of doing the tests was very attractive visually since we saw all the steps that the test carried out but it also gave many problems. The most important is that the tests did not pass when displayed due to an error in the browser. We left pupeeter aside but with the test format that we had creating Promise, this was done without permissions, so once the login was passed, it never got to see the map and it kept loading. We were not able to give permission to the browser, so we left the view visualization part commented after the login.

Finally, we did two simple tests without using Promise to check easy operation

We have developed 6 user acceptance tests:

* In the first one we check if the user can login properly.

        Feature: Login into radarin

        Scenario: We want to login into radarin
            Given The login page
            When We click Log In and enter our information
            Then I expect to be on HomeView of radarin

* The second one cheks if the user can logout correctly.

        Feature: Logout of radarin

        Scenario: The user is registered in the site and wants to unregistered
            Given A registered user
            When I click on log out
            Then The screen of log in

* The third one checks if the user can visualize her friends.

        Feature: See the friends list

        Scenario: The user unregistered wants to see the list friends
            Given The user register in the application
            When The user click the menu and select friends
            Then The user should see his friends

* The next one checks if the user can access to the about.

        Feature: About

        Scenario: The user is registered in the site and wants to go to the about view
            Given A registered user
            When I click on about screen
            Then The screen of the about

* Then the nav one checks navigation.
        
        Feature: Nav display

        Scenario: User opens log in
            When I click the button
            Then I expect to see the log in

* The last one checks the home page.

        Feature: Homepage title
  
        Scenario: User opens the app
            When I go to the homepage
            Then I try to go to the friends view but I can't because I'm not register


By performing these 6 tests indirectly, we are also testing whether the user can easily access the navigation bar, the menu and its views.

=== Load tests

To simulate the different petitions to the application we have used Gatling that is written in Scala. The cases that we have develop are:

* Login with 1 and 15 users.

* Navigation through the application (go to the friends, locate and about view) with 1, 15, 50 and 100 users.

Example of a navigation load test with 15 users
