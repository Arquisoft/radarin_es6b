== System Scope and Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.
****

.Motivation
The aim of the application is to create a system to facilitate meetings between friends using new technologies. The application will be able to access the location information from the users' mobile phone who voluntarily have it activated, and will allow other users, their friends, to know when they are close (notifying them so that they can get in contact).

.Contents
This system will be compatible with SOLID.
Using SOLID technology and SOLID PODs, the system will not store users' personal information centrally, allowing users to communicate with each other in a secure and efficient way.

.Case of use

=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

|Name
|Inputs
|Outputs

|Users
|They receive the location of their friends
|They broadcast their location and they choose who their friends are.

|Aplication
|Receive locations from users and PODs, and can also receive lists of friends
|Share locations or save them to the corresponding PODs

|PODs
|They get requests to submit information, and get locations and friends to save.
|Share information with the application

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

.Herramientas y Framworks utilizados
As we mentioned earlier, the application will use *SOLID* for communication.
For development we will use *React*, an open source JavaScript library, which will make creating user intefaces easier for us.
We will also use *JavaScript* for application development.
