== System Scope and Context

.Motivation
The aim of the application is to create a system to facilitate meetings between friends using new technologies. The application will be able to access the location information from the users' mobile navigator who voluntarily have it activated, and will allow other users, their friends, to know when they are close (notifying them in the mobile so that they can get in contact).

.Contents
This system will be compatible with SOLID.
Using SOLID technology and SOLID PODs, the system will not store users' personal information centrally, allowing users to communicate with each other in a secure and efficient way.

.Case of use

The application is the same although it is accessed through the mobile browser, but to better explain the case of use, in the diagram it is separated into two components.

=== Technical Context

.Herramientas y Framworks utilizados
As we mentioned earlier, the application will use *SOLID* for communication.
For development we will use *React*, an open source JavaScript library, which will make creating user intefaces easier for us.
We will also use *JavaScript* for application development.
To launch the application in the cloud we use a tool called *Heroku*, this tool enables us to build, run and operate the application once in the remote repository.
The locations server is a cloud DBaaS (Database as a Service), more specifically a *MongoDB server*.
