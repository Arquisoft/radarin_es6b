== System Scope and Context

.Motivation
The aim of the application is to create a system to facilitate meetings between friends using new technologies. The application will be able to access the location information from the users' mobile application who voluntarily have it activated, and will allow other users, their friends, to know when they are close (notifying them in the mobile application so that they can get in contact).

.Contents
This system will be compatible with SOLID.
Using SOLID technology and SOLID PODs, the system will not store users' personal information centrally, allowing users to communicate with each other in a secure and efficient way.

=== Technical Context

.Herramientas y Framworks utilizados
As we mentioned earlier, the application will use *SOLID* for communication.
For development we will use *React*, an open source JavaScript library, which will make creating user intefaces easier for us.
We will also use *JavaScript* for application development.
