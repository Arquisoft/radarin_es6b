== Deployment View

=== Infrastructure Level 1

A web browser is necessary for the correct operation of the application, since it works by connecting to the internet
and accessing the server where the POD is located, which having it is a necessary condition to be able to use the app.
This POD uses SOLID and stores the user's personal data in a non-localized way. In the diagram shown below
We illustrate the relationship between the different devices using the PC or the mobile by the user.

Motivation::
The motivation for using what is described above, that is, SOLID, is that the application remains decentralized. In this way the
user is the full owner of the information shared with the app, giving permission to provide the data he wants, making,
in this way, a minimum load of information is stored in the database.
 
Quality and/or Performance Features::
The application database will be lighter, which will encourage better application performance, since most of the data
they will be able to be taken directly from the user's device. User permission will be asked to share certain
information but this will not be stored within the database.

=== Infrastructure Level 2

The application is deployed in Heroku. Heroku create two docker images to run the application, one image contains the webapp and the restapi, and the other one contains the database. Although they are in different boxes, these images can comunicate with each other.
