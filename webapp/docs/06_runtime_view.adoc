== Runtime View


[role="arc42help"]

.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their architectural relevance. It is not important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

Motivation:You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime. 
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).


=== Login

* The data is sent to the Administrator
* The pod denies or allows access

=== Sign up

* The user requests registration from the application.
* The data is sent to the Administrator.
